\section{Additional information}
\par Additional information about LAUXUS implementation can be found in the Appendixes. Such as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item LAUXUS Life State Diagram explaining the state diagram of each user based on his role (cfr. Appendix \ref{appendix:lauxus_life_state_diagram}).
    \item LAUXUS Login Overall process explaining the detailed step by step procedure that must be followed in order for an administrator to add a new user to the Filesystem (cfr. Appendix \ref{appendix:lauxus_login_global_process}).
    \item LAUXUS Structure in action which shows what LAUXUS will look like in real (the difference between the view of the authorised user and the one seen by the remote storage). This show how a single file is split in three subsequent files (one for the content, one for the audit and one for the metadata)(cfr. Appendix \ref{appendix:lauxus_structure}).
\end{itemize}
