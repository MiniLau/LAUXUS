\section{Metadata}
\label{section:lauxus:metadata}

\par As seen in previous sections, we need a data structure to store information corresponding to each filesystem node (e.g: file entitlement, file encryption keys and users registration). We will call this structure the metadata and will be covered in detail in this section. This structure will be secured thanks to the root key. As a quick reminder, it is the key that will be shared with other authorised users to access the filesystem.


\subsection{Structure}
\label{section:lauxus:metadata_structure}

\par As metadata are holding sensitive information about each node, it must be encrypted. However, some information is not required to be encrypted. This is why we designed the metadata to be composed of three parts:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A \textbf{preamble section} holding non-sensitive information such as the size of the associated file for a Filenode, the UUIDs of its children for a Dirnode, etc. This section will only be secured with integrity protection. In this way, we are sure that this section can't be tampered with without being detected.
    \item A \textbf{secured section} holding the sensitive information that can't be divulged. It will thus be encrypted.
    \item A \textbf{cryptographic context} containing the information to securely store the other two sections. Such as the encryption key and the authentication tag to authenticate the preamble section. On top of that, this section will be authenticated and encrypted with the root key. In this way, this section will be at the same time tamper-evident and secured.
\end{itemize}
\par The idea is to have the metadata content secured by its cryptographic context, which in turn, will be secured thanks to the filesystem root key. The root key is protected by the Enclave itself. We applied this procedure to reduce the usage of the root key, and thereby increase its security as it is a long-lived key. The root key is set at the filesystem creation time and is never changed afterwards. Indeed, we can consider that the more we use a cryptographic key, the more it is susceptible to leak data that it was supposed to protect as it is just susceptible to more attacks.


\subsection{Application to the nodes}

    \label{figure:lauxus:metadata_hierarchy}
\end{figure}
\par Now that we have seen the structure of a metadata, we can explain in details which data of a node is located in which section, as described in  Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_hierarchy}.
\par First of all, we see that the metadata is an abstract class used as a wrapper to secure the preamble and secured sections, provided by children classes. In this way, children just need to return the plaintext content of their desired section and everything will be secured using the metadata wrapper.
\par Second, nodes are extending this abstract class through a generic Node class which contains information common to each node type: a list of child nodes and an entitlement list. The first list will be stored in the preamble section and the latter one in the sensitive section. We put the children nodes inside the preamble section because we don't care if an attacker can discover the structure of the hierarchy of the filesystem, as long as the directories and files names are obfuscated.
\par Last, each node type may store complementary information inside the sensitive section. According to the UML diagram in Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_hierarchy}, we see that the supernode stores the list of registered users and the filenode will store the list of block keys of its associated file.


\subsection{Encryption procedure}
\label{section:lauxus:metadata_encryption}

\par As we have seen in the structure of a metadata, the cryptographic context is used to encrypt the required information. Here, we will more focus on the exact procedure and justify the encryption scheme we used.
\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/lauxus/metadata_encryption}
    
    \caption{Metadata structure}
    \label{figure:lauxus:metadata_encryption}
\end{figure}
\par This encryption procedure represented in Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_encryption} explains the full structure of a metadata (as saved on the remote storage).
\par First of all, we start encrypting the secured section using an authenticated scheme (the red key protects the corresponding lock in Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_encryption}). The authenticated additional material used is the preamble section (the red \textbf{AAD} in Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_encryption}). This allows us to protect at the same time both sections: encrypt the secured section and produce a Message Authentication Code (MAC) linked with the preamble section, making both ones tamper-evident. Afterwards, the resulting MAC will be stored inside the cryptographic context (the red \textbf{\#} in Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_encryption}).
\par The authenticated scheme used is AES GCM which is widely used in today's current cryptographic system. As it is constructed on top of AES CTR, its main weakness is its nonce non-re-usability. Indeed, we can't encrypt multiple times using the same IV/Key pair even if the adversary doesn't know the IV, see Appendix \ref{appendix:ctr_nonce_weakness} for demonstration. This justifies the update of the IV of the cryptographic context on every metadata content update.

\medbreak
\par Now that the metadata information is secured, we must secure the information used to secure the metadata content (which is the cryptographic context). As discussed above, we will encrypt them using the root key (the blue key protects the corresponding lock in Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_encryption}). For portability reason, the root key is composed of an encryption key and an IV. This allows us to use a single IV for all the metadata in the filesystem. This means that we can no longer use the AES GCM encryption algorithm as we are reusing the same IV. We will rely on a variant of AES GCM: AES GCM SIV (similar to AES GCM but with IV reusability). With this algorithm, we will encrypt the cryptographic context and save the generated MAC inside the metadata structure (the blue \textbf{\#} in Figure \ref{figure:lauxus:metadata_encryption}).
